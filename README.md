## About The Project

Introduction to Data Science Final Project  September 2021 - Data Visualization 

### Submitter : Shauli Taragin 

### Professor : Dr Roi Yozevitch

In this project we will use all the tools we learned during the course on machine learning, in the First notebook we asked to improve the notebook from last semester to the maximum accuracy we can get with all tools we know until today, in the second notebook we ask to deal with "Fashion Mnist" data set to create the best model can predict the image which each image have label of item, in the third notebook we ask to deal with Cat vs Dogs data frame: a lot of pictures of dogs and cat we try the best to create the best model to predict which the pictures is dog or cat with the best model and features we choose. In the last notebook we ask to deal with hands predicted movevent with 3 status (spontany,alone,sync) the big issue is to know how to load and prepare your data clean and visualization.

In each Notebook i Used , StandardScaler , PCA: dimensionality reduction (each notebook I tryed to reach the maximum accuracy while with the minimum dimension. GridSearching to find the best estimators to reach the highest accuracy.

Classifications Models : KNN , Random Forests, XGBoost, Voting , Bagging, Stacking, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes.
